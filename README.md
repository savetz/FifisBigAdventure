# FifisBigAdventure
a generated book for NaNoGenMo2023

My goal was to create a choose-your-own adventure book that has a story, makes sense, and is fun to play. The result is Fifi's Big Adventure, in which you are a dog walker in a big city, tasked with walking Fifi and running a couple of errands for Fifi's Person. The game consists of a single HTML file: turning pages means clicking links that move the reader to various internal markers within the file.

Every word of the game was written by ChatGPT (September 25 2023 version.) Most of the python code was also written by ChatGPT. The cover art and map were also generated by ChatGPT. I served as project manager and editor.

I took inspiration from Jason Shiga's book "Leviathan", an adventure game comic that has various "states" (such as day and night); and Infocom text adventure games. Fifi's Big Adventure's changeable state is the inventory: the player can have combinations of 5 items, and each location can behave differently based on which items the player has. As a result, there are 18 versions of every location. (Some combinations of items are not possible, which reduces the number of pages.) There are 120 locations in the city, and 2160 pages of content, totaling about 199,500 words. Due to duplication there are about 7,200 unique words.
