<img src="cover.png" width="60%" alt="Warm golden hour light illuminates a cityscape in an oil painting. The main focus is a person walking a standard Poodle that has a unique pink tint. The leash in the person's hand connects them to the dog. Towering buildings stand tall on both sides, and distant figures of other people provide a backdrop, with their shadows stretching on the ground."/>

<p>Preface</p>

<h2>Fifi's Person's Apartment</h2>

<p>The door to the apartment opens with a familiar creak, revealing a warmly lit interior that exudes a sense of home. Plush carpeting muffles your footsteps as you step inside. Immediately, the walls grab your attention — they're adorned with framed photographs of various dogs, their playful antics frozen in time. Among them, Fifi, the mischievous poodle, features prominently, capturing moments of her chasing after a ball or cuddling up on the couch.</p>

<p>A few dog toys — a squeaky bone, a chewed-up tennis ball, and a plushie — are scattered around, hinting at Fifi's recent playtime. From the kitchen, a delicious aroma wafts towards you, hinting at a recently prepared meal. It's a comforting scent, one that mingles with the faint floral notes in the air.</p>

<p>Your thoughts are interrupted by a familiar voice. "Oh, you're here!" Fifi's person, dressed in casual attire, emerges from the adjoining room with a bright smile. Holding onto Fifi's leash, they continue, "She's been eagerly waiting for her walk. And, oh! Before I forget..." They hand you a small, crumpled ticket. "Could you pick up my dry cleaning on your way back? And perhaps buy some fresh flowers for the apartment? It would mean a lot."</p>

<p>As you nod in acknowledgment, Fifi's tail starts wagging furiously, her excitement palpable. She barks happily, clearly thrilled at the prospect of spending time with you.</p>

<p>With the leash in one hand and the dry cleaning ticket in the other, you're ready to embark on an adventure with Fifi by your side.</p>
