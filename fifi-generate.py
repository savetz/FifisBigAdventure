<p>Preface</p>

<h2>Fifi's Person's Apartment</h2>

<p>The door to the apartment opens with a familiar creak, revealing a warmly lit interior that exudes a sense of home. Plush carpeting muffles your footsteps as you step inside. Immediately, the walls grab your attention ‚Äî they're adorned with framed photographs of various dogs, their playful antics frozen in time. Among them, Fifi, the mischievous poodle, features prominently, capturing moments of her chasing after a ball or cuddling up on the couch.</p>

<p>A few dog toys ‚Äî a squeaky bone, a chewed-up tennis ball, and a plushie ‚Äî are scattered around, hinting at Fifi's recent playtime. From the kitchen, a delicious aroma wafts towards you, hinting at a recently prepared meal. It's a comforting scent, one that mingles with the faint floral notes in the air.</p>

<p>Your thoughts are interrupted by a familiar voice. "Oh, you're here!" Fifi's person, dressed in casual attire, emerges from the adjoining room with a bright smile. Holding onto Fifi's leash, they continue, "She's been eagerly waiting for her walk. And, oh! Before I forget..." They hand you a small, crumpled ticket. "Could you pick up my dry cleaning on your way back? And perhaps buy some fresh flowers for the apartment? It would mean a lot."</p>

<p>As you nod in acknowledgment, Fifi's tail starts wagging furiously, her excitement palpable. She barks happily, clearly thrilled at the prospect of spending time with you.</p>

<p>With the leash in one hand and the dry cleaning ticket in the other, you're ready to embark on an adventure with Fifi by your side.</p>
